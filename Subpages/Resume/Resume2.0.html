                   <span class="hightlight">Neural Kissan /Co-Founder</span><br>
                    <span class="DateAndPlace">September 2022 - Current ,  Goa,OnSite</span>
                    <br>I worked in the startup Neural Kissan first as the designer where i designed CAD models for 3D Printing,laser cutting and PreViz later i went on to work on the design and backend of the software

                    <span class="DateAndPlace">September 2022 - October 2022 ,  USA,Remote</span>
                    <br>The Computer Event Of <a href="http://dbcegoa.ac.in/"><b>Don Bosco College Of Engineering</b></a> Needed a website, Being acoustomed with intermediate web design i created the style for the whole website
                    
                    <br><br><span class="hightlight"><a href="https://www.yellowducknft.com/" class="jobLink">YellowDuckNFT</a> / 3D Artist</span><br>
                    <span class="DateAndPlace">December 2021 - February 2022,  USA,Remote</span>
                    <br>This job was one of the most fun and tiring jobs i've done,i learnt a lot about working in teams and collaboration,meeting deadlines and in the field of 3d i learnt mass managing and rendering of more than 4000 videos,made nfts almost every day,which we posted on our twitter to increase engagement  
                    
                    <br><br><span class="hightlight">MiningPassNFT /3D Artist</span><br>
                    <span class="DateAndPlace">December 2021 - January 2021 ,  USA,Remote</span>
                    <br>I got this job between the  YellowDuckNFT project,Both the projects were by the same person and some additional people,sadly the project was never launched, but I did learn a lot of stuff here, mostly all about nfts and how they work etc.
                    
                    <br><br><span class="hightlight">DeathlessDAO /3D Artist</span><br>
                    <span class="DateAndPlace">December 2021 - January 2021 ,  USA,Remote</span>
                    <br>This job was done completely by me ,the idea was generated using an ai called Dall-E 2 which i then modeled and sculpted,then sent multiple revisions One of the problem i encountered was the errors in rendering which i had to replace (~100 out of 2000NFTs) ,for this i used bash to do it programmatically
